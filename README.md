# avalanche-github

This is a github repo with as much as we can share of Avalanche.

Avalanche is a mod for Snowtopia, developed by @chazzvader (Charles Bruel), @!Tea, and @define me as Bamsen. Tea primarily manages the website and installer and occasionally does minor changes to the code. Bamsen primarily work on the money aspect of the mod, mostly the balancing. Chazzvader/Charles Bruel does everything else, all the loading of custom assets, performance, instanced rendering, custom maps, custom lifts, everything.

This project by its nature cannot have a fully up to date repo. Development is done in Unity, VS, VSCode, DNSpy, etc. and this is a compilation from various sources. Additionally, most of the code is changes to Assembly-CSharp.dll, which is means most of the code is intertwined and impossible to seperate from original game (proprietary) and so we cannot share it. Any code that exists is purely our own, does not contain reference to other internal elements nor is based on proprietary code.
