The core parts of the mod are made by modifying Assembly-CSharp.dll with DNSpy. Since my code is in many places fundementally connected to original game code, I cannot share most of it here. This folder is an incomplete record of the code involved in Avalanche, mostly utilities that are completely my own and completely seperable from Snwotopia. This code will not work on it's own.

Some of these classes are partial classes, where I show only my code. This is not entirely consistent, and this is not exhaustive of everything I could show.

These utilities are taken directly from DNSpy, so they lack any comments or proper local variable names, and still contain the auto-generated debug info.

DISCLAIMER: It's entirely possible these get out of date, as I need to copy over any changes manually. If you find a discrepency, open an issue and I'll fix it.
